Here’s what I worked on over winter break: 

## Job applications
I will be graduating this semester, so I need to have a job locked down for when I graduate. I’m applying to banking and data science positions primarily. 

## Budgeting plans for the semester
I’ve learned that it’s a lot easier to feel financially secure if you plan your budget out and have a mental account of what is going to be coming in and out of your bank account for the next five to six months. 

Investing Plans for the semester. 
With a modest return in safe assets, I’ve found that I can put some money into the stock market and make enough back over the coming months to cover a week or two of groceries. While this doesn’t sound like a lot, saving money here and there can ease a lot of burden down the road. 

## Having fun
I went to a Lakers game with one of my friends, Vahagn. I had never been to a regular season game, so I found the experience incredible. Premier seating was also a treat. 
In addition, I enjoy running. I’ve been running most days and plan to get a couple of bike rides in per usual. I love the outdoors and spending time in nature. 

## Relaxing
I’ve done a little bit of reading and, for once, allowed myself to watch television. I finished the first season of Only Murders in the Building. The show was a tad cheesy but sometimes that is what’s best. I’m not entirely sure what I’m going to watch next, but I am excited. I also have had a fantastic time catching up with my family and spending time with them. 

Of course, the above outlines an incredibly privileged human being. Each time I come home after a semester at school, I realize how lucky I am to be in the position I am. To anyone reading this, just know that I am incredibly thankful for what has been given to me. If you are going through hardship, reach out or let me know. I am always happy to help in whatever capacity I may. 

Stay awesome, stay healthy, get vaccinated, wear masks, and stay tough. We will get through this.
