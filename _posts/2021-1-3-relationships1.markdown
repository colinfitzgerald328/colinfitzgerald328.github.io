Relationships. Many of them, so much to learn.

Pain, happiness, joy, maturity, immaturity, loss, grief, wisdom. Those are some words I use to describe the relationships that I’ve been in in my life.

When you break up with someone or get broken up with, pain ensues. You lose a best friend, someone that you’ve been on a journey with. You lose one of your closest companions. But with every loss, of course come many lessons. You are forced to reflect on what went wrong. Maybe you blame yourself, or do you blame them?

You must reflect, you must learn. You must improve yourself and figure out what poor decisions both you and your significant other made. That doesn’t mean there weren’t fun times too; you can’t be bitter. But you must understand.

I’ve healed from that loss, temporarily. Who knows what any of us are in for in the future?

I’ve been in two serious relationships, and each one shows you the way; it helps you to hone in on what to look for, what to avoid, and how you can improve yourself.

It’s painful in moments, but when you come out on the other side you are so much stronger and have more wisdom. It’s clear that there is still much to learn, but another step in the journey of life has been crossed. One path, of many.
