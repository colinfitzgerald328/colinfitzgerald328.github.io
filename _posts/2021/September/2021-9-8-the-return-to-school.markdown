So what's it like to return to NCAA competition and in-person learning for the first time in 538 days? It's a bit odd, I can tell you that much. 

I spent much of quarantine in solace, accompanied by my family. 

Prior to the pandemic, I, like many of my peers, lived the Division 1 Student-Athlete lifestyle. 

Running was my identity. While I was both student and athlete, I was more focused on being an athlete, forgoing career opportunities in favor of prioritizing athletic success. 

When the pandemic hit, I did a complete 180. I know I wasn't the only one to do so. For the first time in many of our lives, the so-called "music" had stopped. 

We were forced to look inwards and truly consider our life choices for the first time ever. Ferociously, I applied to internships. 

A major part of my identity was now gone. It was time to officially start over. 

Academically, my identity switched to full-time student. 

During the summer of 2020, I took the maximum course load, knocking out Econometrics and Microeconomics, two upper-division requirements for my major. In my free time, I learned to code using Python. I also made the decision to add Data Science as my minor; I was no longer afraid of quant-heavy courses. I might also mention here that I was still running 75 miles per week. The difference was, I was on my own now. 

During the Fall and Spring of 2020, I completed my entire Economics degree, save for one final course. At the same time, I worked on completing the prerequisite courses for the Data Science minor. 

In the Spring of 2020, I started to, once again, seek professional opportunities. I found luck in the OCFO, a Berkeley-affiliated club that I joined and used to hone some basic Microsoft Excel skills. Slowly, I began to add real experience to my resume. 

I completed three rounds of interviews during that semester and landed my first internship position. 

In the summer of 2020, I worked full-time at CoreVest Finance, a mortgage-lending firm. Applying my data science and statistics skills, I successfully built the company a machine learning algorithm to predict loan-closing status with 97.8% accuracy during my ten weeks with the firm. 

On August 21, 2020, I returned to U.C. Berkeley for the first time in 538 days. If you do the math, that's almost 1.5 years. The best part? I returned in shape, ready to run, and complete my final year at the school. 

I am approaching this final year with thanks. 

From the bottom of my heart, I want to thank everyone that has helped me make it this far in life. My life is so easy and I’m so blessed. I would be nothing without all of you guys. Without we, I do not exist. I’m not looking back anymore, it’s all eyes forward from here.
