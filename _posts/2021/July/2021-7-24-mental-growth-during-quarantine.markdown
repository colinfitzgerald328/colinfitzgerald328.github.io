## A Short Synopsis of How I Grew During Quarantine

Freeing your soul is both one of the most difficult and rewarding things to do. 

I used to struggle with negativity. 

My mind was filled with thoughts telling myself that I had no self worth, lacked intelligence, and was good for nothing. 

 Then I read The Book of Joy. 

That book had a profound impact on how I approach life on a daily basis. 

For so long I struggled to battle my mind and keep the resounding negativity at bay. 

But I found solace in The Book of Joy. A chapter here and there kept my head on straight.  It kept me going and kept me focused.

Now, people see me and say, “What are you smiling about? Why do you look so happy?”

My face is plastered with a smile because I have begun to discover my sense of joy. 

I thank the Dalai Lama and the Book of Joy for teaching me how to think differently about life. 

Now, I look forward to, and appreciate each day. 

It’s not about you, me, or anyone else. It’s about us, one humanity, and our common struggle. We are on one journey together. 

The most beautiful thing about life is learning to free your soul, develop a true sense of joy, and discover the floating feeling that comes with it. 

Negativity will pervade, but once you’ve built your foundation, nothing can stop you. 

Stay calm in the wind, keep going, and your confidence will grow. 

Until next time, 

Colin.
