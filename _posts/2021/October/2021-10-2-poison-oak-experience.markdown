No, not again, I thought. The small red dots began to appear on my skin again. Then the little bumps raised and became swollen.

“Poison oak.”

I dashed to my dresser and grabbed what remains I had of triamcinolone acetonide 0.1%. I dabbed a bit on each area. 

I waited a day. No change. The red streaks got worse. My knee swelled further. When I ran, my right leg felt like a lead weight. 

“This isn’t good.”

I debated whether to go to the doctor. I followed my instinct. I submitted an e-visit. 

The doctor prescribed prednisone. I was weary, cautious at best.  

“This stuff again? The stuff that gives me intrusive thoughts and insomnia but, at the end of the day, is the only thing that can cure this skin reaction?”

I decided to take the risk. Four pills the next morning. I got my run in, didn’t feel any different. 

Tuesday night. Twelve pills later. My head begins to throb. I take Benadryl to calm the itching. I lay my head to rest, ready to turn in. 5 hours later I am awoken by my head. It’s in serious pain. I can’t sleep. I toss and turn. I get up. I pace around the room. I go to the restroom. I sit down on the floor and try to manage the pounding in my head. I go back to my room. I turn the light on. I turn it off. I try to go back to bed. My head is spinning. My stomach starts to hurt. I feel queasy. I grab my trash can and put it next to my bed. I walk to the bathroom. I kneel by the toilet. I take a deep breath. I can feel it coming. Deep breath again. Something wants to come up, but not quite yet. Another deep breath. A rush to the surface. I expel what I need to. I flush the toilet. My temples pulse. I take another deep breath and swallow. I drink some water and head back to my room. I manage to go back to bed for about thirty minutes. The hours wane. Time seems endless.

Seven.  I throw on some sweatpants, a sweatshirt, and some sneakers. I trudge to 7-11. Barely cognizant, I purchase Tylenol, a Gatorade, and some saltines. I trudge home. I sip on the Gatorade. I take one Tylenol with a glass of water. The pain begins to subside, slowly.
