The U.S. economy has been on one of the most turbulent rides in history. After a major recession, it grew strongly for several years but then slowed sharply and fell into another recession, which ended almost eight years ago. How will it perform in the future? The question is not simple to answer because economics is an unpredictable science. 

## The Impact of COVID-19 On the U.S. Economy 
You might be asking yourself, what was the impact of COVID-19 on the U.S. Economy? Well, you've come to the right place, because I'm here to answer your questions. Later in this article, we'll take a look at what some experts predict for the future of the U.S. Economy in 2021. 

## Top Economic Indicators 
### **The Vix** 
The Volatility Index, or VIX, measures volatility in the stock market.
When the VIX is low, volatility is low. When the VIX is high volatility is high, which is usually accompanied by market fear.
Buying when the VIX is high and selling when it is low is a strategy, but one that needs to be considered against other factors and indicators.

### **The S&P 500**
 The S&P 500 is composed of 500 of the largest companies traded on either the NYSE or the NASDAQ.
Investors who want to invest in the S&P index can purchase an index fund or exchange-traded fund that seeks to match the performance of the S&P 500.
The S&P 500 is calculated by adding each company's float-adjusted market capitalization.
In order to be included in the S&P 500, a company must meet certain requirements including achieving a specific market cap, having a majority of its shares in public hands, and being a public company for at least a year.
A company must have a market cap of $13.1 billion to be included in the S&P 500 index.

### **Interest Rates** 
The interest rate is the amount charged on top of the principal by a lender to a borrower for the use of assets.
Most mortgages use simple interest. However, some loans use compound interest, which is applied to the principal but also to the accumulated interest of previous periods.
A loan that is considered low risk by the lender will have a lower interest rate. A loan that is considered high risk will have a higher interest rate.
Consumer loans typically use an APR, which does not use compound interest.
The APY is the interest rate that is earned at a bank or credit union from a savings account or certificate of deposit (CD). Savings accounts and CDs use compounded interest.

### **Oil Prices** 
Like most commodities, the fundamental driver of oil's price is supply and demand in the market.
Oil markets are composed of speculators who are betting on price moves, and hedgers who are limiting risk in the production or consumption of oil.
Oil supply is controlled somewhat by a cartel of oil-producing nations called OPEC.
Oil demand is driven by everything from gasoline for cars and airline travel to electrical generation. (Investopedia.com). 
### **Human Sentiment** 
Economic sentiment rebounded over the last two weeks, ending a slide that lasted from the end of April to the end of June. The HPS-CivicScience Economic Sentiment Index (ESI) jumped 1.5 points on the back of strong gains in confidence in making a major purchase and confidence in the housing market—the same indicators that had been driving the recent drop in economic sentiment.

## **What the Experts Have to Say**  
Economics teachers and writers have had a shot at predicting where the economy is headed in the near future. Below are predictions of three economics/finance experts:

## 1. Paul Krugman
### *Nobel laureate economist; professor of economics, Princeton University; columnist for The New York Times.*

"Despite some growing pains, the U.S. economy is clearly on a vaccine-and-stimulus-fueled tear, with just about every measure indicating rapid recovery from the pandemic slump.

Yes, supply bottlenecks have caused some inflation, although recent data seems to validate the view that this inflation is transitory: Lumber prices have fallen sharply, industrial metals have also come down, and used car prices seem to have peaked. Yes, some employers seem to be having trouble hiring enough workers to keep up with surging demand, but this will almost surely be a temporary problem.

Overall, we’re clearly in a much better place economically than we were just a few months ago."

## 2. Jeff Nielson
### *Economics writer; editor of Bullion Bulls Canada*

On inflation, Nielson contends that "Folkerts-Landau’s report is a cynical exercise: pretending that central banks are choosing to accept something that they are helpless to prevent. Understanding this requires a more sophisticated understanding of inflation.

This was provided to readers in a recent Dynamic Wealth Research article.

You dilute a stock and it loses value. You dilute a currency and it loses value.

It’s not a difficult concept to grasp unless you happen to be a central banker or an economist. To these “experts”, the concept of dilution is unfathomable.

The dilution of the U.S. dollar is as undeniable as it is extreme.    

Indeed, the (correct) economic definition of inflation is to increase (“inflate”) the supply of money.

Dilute the currency by increasing the supply. The currency loses value. Prices rise. Cause and effect.

Once upon a time, real economists understood this.

Inflation is always and everywhere a monetary phenomenon in the sense that it can be produced only by a more rapid increase in the quantity of money than output. [emphasis mine] - Milton Friedman, 1970
But today, in the fantasy world of Western central bankers and modern pseudo-economists, such cause-and-effect doesn’t exist. Central banks aren’t causing the recent explosion in inflation, they are merely accepting it.

The reality is that have absolutely no choice.

After you initiate a cause, you can’t wish away the effect. The U.S. dollar (along with other Western currencies) has been diluted – past tense. Now we are reaping the consequences: soaring inflation.

Back to revisionism. According to Folkerts-Landau:

The most immediate manifestation of the shift in macro policy is that the fear of inflation, and of rising levels of government debt, that shaped a generation of policymakers is receding.

## 3. David Rosenberg 
### *Chief economist and strategist, Gluskin Sheff & Associates Inc.; economics columnist for the Toronto Sun and author of the daily economic report "Morning Briefing"*       

"It is not surprising to us, given our in-house views on inflation, but it appears that equity investors are hitting the pause button when it comes to the reflation trade. As per the latest update of our “inflation” index, the seemingly unrelenting surge from November till May has come to an end, having flatlined for the past month and a half.

This comes as market-based measures of inflation expectations also peaked last month, and it appears that investors are now taking a wait-and-see approach as to what comes next on this front. Should this inflationary bump prove to be transitory (as expected), then look for this trade to go into reverse in the coming months."

## Conclusion
It's hard to predict the future, but I'm cautiously optimistic about where the economy is headed. We were initially down with the advent of COVID-19, but we're finally on an upswing and headed towards normalcy. The stock market has skyrocketed and unemployment rates are going down.  We have no reason to believe that this is going to change any time soon.

Until next week,
