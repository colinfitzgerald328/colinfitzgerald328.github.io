Minimal Mistakes is a flexible two-column Jekyll theme. Perfect for hosting your personal site, blog, or portfolio on GitHub or self-hosting on your own server. As the name implies --- styling is purposely minimalistic to be enhanced and customized by you :smile:.

Minimal Mistakes is designed, developed, and maintained by Michael Rose. Here is a link to the [GitHub page](https://github.com/mmistakes/minimal-mistakes) where you can find all of the sources that power and maintain this website.

The inspiration for my website was from one of my friends who is also a current U.C. Berkeley Student. I learned to and took inspiration from his workflow. Here is a link to [Ravi's website](https://raviriley.github.io).
