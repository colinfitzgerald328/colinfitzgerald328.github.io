My name is Colin FitzGerald. 

I am currently a student at the University of California, Berkeley. 

My major is Economics while my minor is in Data Science.

During quarantine, I decided to learn to code since I didn't have any prior experience. 

I was awful at first. I struggled and couldn't grasp even the most basic concepts. However, I was persistent and patient with myself. 

Slowly, I am becoming more confident in my ability to code. I find it interesting; to me, it's one huge puzzle. 

I started small with simple python projects and dabbled a little bit in R. 

As I have continued through the years, I find myself enjoying coding more and more. One day, I hope to contribute to projects that can change the world. Until then, I'm working hard to learn as much as I can. 

My time in coding is split between Website projects and Data Science as of now. 

The inspiration for my website was from one of my friends who is also a current U.C. Berkeley Student. I learned to and took inspiration from his workflow. Here is a link to [Ravi's website](https://raviriley.github.io).
