## My name is Colin FitzGerald.

 I am a 21 Year Old Student-Athlete at the University of California, Berkeley.

 I created this blog to share parts of my life story and to give myself motivation to
 innovate my artwork, photography, self, and personal brand.

 The site currently runs through my own [GitHub](https://github.com/colinfitzgerald328) account as well as [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) to support the layout. I have much to learn in the world of Website Programming, but this is my start. I hope to grow and learn to design an elegant website in the future. I aspire to be an Economics researcher and have a website where I can share my own projects.
